## TODO, ideas

[ ] Show user that band has no published tracks  
[x] When search deleted, load random bands  
[ ] Notify user somehow that search is being performed (maybe little spinner in search field)  
[ ] Maybe apply gestures for some actions (like back from Band profile to bands search)  
[x] Rework band profile, find out how to put band info into list so it does not occupy space on screen and can be scrolled out
